            <h3 id="headline">Overview of Ironman's career</h3>
                <p><b>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark</b> was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Avengers" title="Avengers">Avengers</a>, and the former CEO of <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Stark_Industries" title="Stark Industries">Stark Industries</a>, a company originally started by his father, <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Howard_Stark" title="Howard Stark">Howard Stark</a>. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men, and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Tony_Stark" title="Kidnapping of Tony Stark">kidnapped</a> by the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Ten_Rings" title="Ten Rings">Ten Rings</a> in <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Afghanistan" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, while demonstrating a fleet of <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Jericho" title="Jericho">Jericho</a> missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Man_Armor:_Mark_I" title="Iron Man Armor: Mark I">armored suit</a> which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Obadiah_Stane" title="Obadiah Stane" class="mw-redirect">Obadiah Stane</a> who turned against Stark. Stark enjoyed the fame that came with his new secret identity and decided to share it with the world, publicly revealing himself as <b>Iron Man</b>.
                </p><p>Fresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark found himself dying due to his own <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Arc_Reactor" title="Arc Reactor">Arc Reactor</a> poisoning his body, all while he was challenged by <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Ivan_Vanko" title="Ivan Vanko" class="mw-redirect">Ivan Vanko</a> who attempted to destroy his legacy. Due to their assistance in both these battles, Stark reluctantly agreed to serve as a consultant for <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D." title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> where he used his position to upgrade their technology while he began a relationship with <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Pepper_Potts" title="Pepper Potts">Pepper Potts</a>. With the world yet again being threatened, Stark joined the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Avengers" title="Avengers">Avengers</a> and helped defeat the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Chitauri" title="Chitauri">Chitauri</a> and <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Loki" title="Loki">Loki</a>. Due to the battle, he suffered from <a href="//en.wikipedia.orghttps://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Posttraumatic stress disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, leading him to create the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Legion" title="Iron Legion">Iron Legion</a> to safeguard the world and help him retire.
                </p><p>Threats of the Mandarin forced Stark to come out of retirement to protect his country, inadvertently putting his loved ones at risk and leaving him defenseless when his home was destroyed. Stark continued his mission, finding <a href="h_Killian" title="Aldrich Killian">Aldrich Killian</a> was behind the attacks and that <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Trevor_Slattery" title="Trevor Slattery">Trevor Slattery</a> was a pretend Mandarin. Eventually, Stark defeated Killian, almost losing Pepper Potts in the process. In the wake of the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_on_the_Norco" title="Battle on the Norco">battle</a>, Stark destroyed all of his armors with the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Clean_Slate_Protocol" title="Clean Slate Protocol">Clean Slate Protocol</a>. However, when the Avengers were officially demobilized due to the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/War_on_HYDRA" title="War on HYDRA">War on HYDRA</a>, Stark built more armors and resumed his role as Iron Man, aiding them in the capture of <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Strucker" title="Wolfgang von Strucker">Wolfgang von Strucker</a> and acquiring Loki's <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Scepter" title="Scepter">Scepter</a>.
                </p><p>Once the threat of HYDRA had been ended, at last, Stark, influenced by <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Wanda_Maximoff" title="Wanda Maximoff" class="mw-redirect">Wanda Maximoff</a>'s mind games, built <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Ultron" title="Ultron">Ultron</a> with the help of <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Bruce_Banner" title="Bruce Banner" class="mw-redirect">Bruce Banner</a> as a new peace-keeping A.I. to protect the world and allow the Avengers to retire. However, Ultron believed that humanity threatened the world and thus, according to his program, decided to extinguish humanity. Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Sokovia" title="Battle of Sokovia">defeated</a>, however not without massive civilian cost and many lives being lost. After the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Ultron_Offensive" title="Ultron Offensive">Ultron Offensive</a>, Stark retired from active duty, still haunted by his role in the chaos the A.I. created. The guilt of creating Ultron and causing so much destruction and loss of life eventually convinced Stark to support the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Sokovia_Accords" title="Sokovia Accords">Sokovia Accords</a>. However, Stark's own strong support of the Accords lead to a disagreement with his ally <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_America" title="Captain America">Captain America</a>, who opposed the act and what it meant for the team.
                </p><p>When Rogers then proceeded to further break the law to protect the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Winter_Soldier" title="Winter Soldier">Winter Soldier</a>, Stark was forced to lead the manhunt for his old ally, igniting the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Avengers_Civil_War" title="Avengers Civil War">Avengers Civil War</a>. Eventually, Stark learned that <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Helmut_Zemo" title="Helmut Zemo">Helmut Zemo</a> had manipulated them into conflict and rejoined his friend, only to have Zemo revealed that Barnes was responsible for the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Assassination_of_Howard_and_Maria_Stark" title="Assassination of Howard and Maria Stark">murder</a> of his parents, causing Stark to seek revenge and <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_at_the_HYDRA_Siberian_Facility" title="Battle at the HYDRA Siberian Facility">fight</a> both Rogers and Barnes. Rogers, aided by the interference of Barnes and Stark's subsequent distraction and mindless grief, managed to disable the armor and put an end to the fight. With Rogers on the run and Barnes in <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Wakanda" title="Wakanda">Wakanda</a>, Stark returned to <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> to become a mentor to <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Spider-Man" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> and to guide him in order to make him a better hero than he ever was.
                </p><p>Stark proposed to Potts, and was recruited by <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor_Strange" title="Doctor Strange">Doctor Strange</a> and <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Bruce_Banner" title="Bruce Banner" class="mw-redirect">Bruce Banner</a> to defend <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> from <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Thanos" title="Thanos">Thanos</a> and the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Order" title="Black Order">Black Order</a>. Strange was <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_on_Greenwich_Village" title="Attack on Greenwich Village">captured</a>, prompting Stark and <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Spider-Man" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> to rescue him from captivity and travel to <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Titan" title="Titan">Titan</a> to <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Titan" title="Battle of Titan">battle</a> Thanos with the help of the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy" title="Guardians of the Galaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>. Stark later battled one-on-one with Thanos and made him bleed but was subsequently beaten to submission. He was ready to die in order to save the universe, but Doctor Strange interfered. Strange surrendered the Time Stone to Thanos in exchange for Stark's life. Stark remained on Titan with <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Nebula" title="Nebula">Nebula</a> as they watched their allies disintegrate into ashes.
                </p><p>Stark and Nebula used the <i><a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Benatar" title="Benatar">Benatar</a></i> to escape Titan, but were stranded in space as the ship was damaged. They were <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Rescue_of_Tony_Stark" title="Rescue of Tony Stark">rescued</a> by <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Marvel" title="Captain Marvel">Captain Marvel</a>, who brought them to the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/New_Avengers_Facility" title="New Avengers Facility">New Avengers Facility</a>. While Nebula joined the Avengers, Stark chose to retire, marrying Potts and having a daughter, <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Morgan_Stark" title="Morgan Stark">Morgan Stark</a>. In <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/2023" title="2023">2023</a>, five years after the Snap, Stark rejoined the Avengers after discovering the key to travel through time, traveling back to <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/2012" title="2012">2012</a> to <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Theft_of_the_Mind_Stone" title="Theft of the Mind Stone">retrieve the Scepter</a> and then to <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/1970s" title="1970s">1970</a> to <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Theft_of_the_Space_Stone" title="Theft of the Space Stone">regain the Tesseract</a>. After gaining all of the six Infinity Stones, Stark used them to eliminate Thanos and his army once and for all, sacrificing his life in the process. At Stark’s funeral, his family, the other Avengers, and their allies and friends honored his sacrifice.
                </p><p>In the event of his death and the successful resurrection of the dusted people, Stark decided to choose <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Spider-Man" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> as his successor by giving him an A.I. called <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/E.D.I.T.H." title="E.D.I.T.H.">E.D.I.T.H.</a> who could control all Stark technology. Spider-Man later had to protect E.D.I.T.H from <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Mysterio" title="Mysterio">Mysterio</a> and his accomplices who were former Stark Industries employees that had a grudge against Stark for seemingly passing off their ideas as his own.
